Hello!ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my home on GitHub for my tutorials and experiments in data science, machine learning, and other related stuff.
Below is a list of everything I've published so far in this repository.

## [Building a Matplotlib to Plotly chart converter](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/shaildeliwala/experiments/blob/master/Matplotlib%20to%20Plotly%20Chart%20Conversion.ipynb)
An experiment in converting Matplotlib bar charts and scatter plots created using pandas to Plotly plots.

## [Airbnb data analysis and predictions](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/shaildeliwala/experiments/blob/master/Airbnb%20data%20analysis%20and%20predictions.ipynb)
EDA and predictive experiments on Airbnb data of New York City. In this notebook, I have treated both price prediction and number-of-guests prediction problems in two ways: as a regression problem and as a classification problem. There is a comparison of both approaches.

## [Streamlit 101: An in-depth introduction](https://github.com/shaildeliwala/experiments/blob/master/streamlit.py)
[Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io) is an awesome new tool that allows engineers to quickly build highly interactive web applications around their data, machine learning models, and pretty much anything. This tutorial is a deep dive into Streamlit with Airbnb NYCÂ listings data.

More stuff coming up soon! ðŸ˜Ž
